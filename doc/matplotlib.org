#+title: Introduction to Matplotlib
#+setupfile: setup.org

The main tutorial for matplotlib is contained in
code/[[../code/matplotlib_tutorial.ipynb][matplotlib_tutorial.ipynb]]. The best way to get this file is by
[[./syncing-tutorial.org][syncing]] with the git repo.

To start the notebook, go to that directory in a terminal shell and run
=ipython notebook=.

In addition to running and tweaking the examples in the matplotlib
tutorial notebook, you should use matplotlib to reproduce a few plots
you've made using other software.
