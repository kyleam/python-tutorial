We have been covering testing your code as we go along. This page will
just provide some relevant links.

* Types of testing

We have only focused on unit tests, which isolate a small part of the
code (e.g., a single function) and test that it is working as expected.
The relationship between unit tests and other types of tests
(integration and functional) is described nicely [[http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/testing.html][here]].

* Unit testing frameworks

We have been using [[http://pytest.org/latest/][pytest]]. The other popular (and builtin) framework is
[[http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/unittest.html][unittest]].
