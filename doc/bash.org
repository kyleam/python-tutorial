#+title: Bash cheat sheet

* Getting information on commands

Access the manual:

: man <command of interest>

If this doesn't work (the program doesn't have a manual), usually it is
safe to try running the command with typical help flags:

#+begin_example
  <command of interest> --help
  <command of interest> -h
#+end_example

* Directory (folder) operations

** listing the contents of a directory

: ls

** change directories

: cd <directory>

=~= stands for your home directory. So this would take you to your home
directory:

: cd ~

And this would take you to your downloads folder under you home
directory:

: cd ~/downloads

** show your current (present) directory

: pwd

* File operations

** copying a file

: cp <file name> <new file name>

** rename (move) a file

: mv <file name> <new file name>

** deleting (removing) a file

: rm <file>

** viewing the contents of a text file

Print the entire contents of a file to the terminal screen:

: cat <file>

Load the file so that you can scroll and search the contents:

: less <file>

When viewing a file with less, move down with =j= and up with =k=.
Search by pressing =/= and then entering the search term. Leave the file
with =q=.
