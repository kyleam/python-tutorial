**Merge program information**

(from Sirisha)

``data/program-versions.csv`` lists the names of a few programs
and their current version.
``data/program-dates.csv`` lists the names of the same programs
and their release date.
Write a script that merges this information into a single file
that has three columns.
It would look something like this::

  Program,Date,Version
  Firefox,July,12
  ...

What we started today is in ``code/merge_program_info.py``,
so you can work from there if you'd like.
