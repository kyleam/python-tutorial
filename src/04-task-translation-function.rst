**Amino acid translation function**

Write a function that translates a DNA sequence to an amino acid sequence.

  In [1]: translate('GTACCC')

It's up to you to decide how you want to deal with stop codons.
I've already added a codon to amino acid dictionary
in ``codon_mapping.py``.
You can access this in your script by importing it.

Write tests (either with plain assert statements or py.test) to show
that your code is working properly.
