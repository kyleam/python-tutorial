# Materials for a weekly Python tutorial

This repository consists of materials (written tutorials, toy data, and
in-class code) for a weekly (and ongoing) Python class for biologists
with no programming experience.

The written tutorials can be accessed [here][tutorials]. They are
intended to supplement the meetings, so they may not be too useful on
their own.
