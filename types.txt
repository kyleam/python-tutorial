 Types in Python
=================

Some of the major types of variables in python include

1. Boolean
2. intergers
3. floats
4. strings
5. lists
6. dictionaries


Boolean
=======

Boolean values are represented by ``True`` and ``False`` (no
quotes). The often are produced by comparison operations.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> 3 > 2
   True
   >>> 10/5 == 1
   False

Integers
========

Pretty much what you would expect (although integer division may be
surprising)

.. code-block:: python

  >>> x = 1
  >>> x + 3
  4


Floats
======

Again, as expected

.. code-block:: python

  >>> x = 1.0
  >>> x + 3
  4.0

If you add an integer to a float, the result will be a float.


Strings
=======

These are characters and words. They must be surrounded by either single
or double quotes.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> name = 'john'

Strings have some convenient methods associated with them. For example:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> name.upper()
  'JOHN'
  >>> name.capitalize()
  'John'


Lists
=====

A list is a sequence of values

.. code-block:: python

  >>> primes = [2, 3, 5]

Each value can be accessed indiviudally

.. code-block:: python

  >>> primes[0]
  2
  >>> primes[2]
  5

The index (the value inside the brackets) is 0-based.

Lists can also be iterated over one-by-one

.. code-block:: python

  >>> for prime in primes:
  ...     print prime
  2
  3
  5


Dicts
=====

Provides key-value lookup.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> prices = {'car' : 40000, 'pop' : 1}
  >>> prices['pop']
  1
