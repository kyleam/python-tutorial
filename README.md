# Materials for a weekly Python tutorial

This repository consists of materials (written tutorials, toy data, and
in-class code) from a Python class for biologists with no programming
experience.

The written tutorials can be accessed [here][tutorials]. They were
intended to supplement the meetings, so they may not be too useful on
their own.
